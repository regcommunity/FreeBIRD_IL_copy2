They are treated as equity securities if the following criteria are met: a) the holder’s claims are subordinated, b)the holder’s remuneration is performance related and c) capital is provided for an unlimited period, or at least on a long-term basis. In light of these criteria, most participation certificates are considered to be equity securities. 3.47 “Genussscheine” (or “Genussrechte”) are a type of participation certificate.
