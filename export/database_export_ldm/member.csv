""...this category comprises credit granted [...] either via delayed debit cards, i.e. cards providing convenience credit as defined below, or via credit cards, i.e. cards providing convenience credit and extended credit. .Credit card debt is recorded on dedicated card accounts and therefore not evident on current or overdraft accounts. Convenience credit is defined as the credit granted at an interest rate of 0 % in the period between the payment transactions effectuated with the card during one billing cycle and the date at which the debit balances from this specific billing cycle become due. Extended credit is defined as the credit granted after the due dates of the previous billing cycles have passed, i.e. debit amounts on the card account that have not been settled when this was first possible, for which an interest rate or tiered interest rates usually greater than 0 % are charged. Often minimum instalments per month have to be made, to at least partially repay extended credit.
The counterpart to these forms of credit is the entity liable to eventually repay the amounts outstanding in accordance with the contractual agreement, which coincides with the cardholder in the case of privately used cards, but not in the case of company cards;"""

...
2. ""Partner enterprises"" are all enterprises which are not classified as linked enterprises within the meaning of paragraph 3 and between which there is the following relationship: an enterprise (upstream enterprise) holds, either solely or jointly with one or more linked enterprises within the meaning of paragraph 3, 25 % or more of the capital or voting rights of another enterprise (downstream enterprise).

However, an enterprise may be ranked as autonomous, and thus as not having any partner enterprises, even if this 25 % threshold is reached or exceeded by the following investors, provided that those investors are not linked, within the meaning of paragraph 3, either individually or jointly to the enterprise in question:

(a) public investment corporations, venture capital companies, individuals or groups of individuals with a regular venture capital investment activity who invest equity capital in unquoted businesses (""business angels""), provided the total investment of those business angels in the same enterprise is less than EUR 1250000;

(b) universities or non-profit research centres;

(c) institutional investors, including regional development funds;

...
3. ‘Linked enterprises’ are enterprises which have any of the following relationships with each other:
(a) an enterprise has a majority of the shareholders' or members' voting rights in another enterprise;
(b) an enterprise has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another enterprise;
(c) an enterprise has the right to exercise a dominant influence over another enterprise pursuant to a contract entered
into with that enterprise or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association;
(d) an enterprise, which is a shareholder in or member of another enterprise, controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that enterprise, a majority of shareholders' or members' voting rights in that enterprise.
There is a presumption that no dominant influence exists if the investors listed in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 are not involving themselves directly or indirectly in the management of the enterprise in question, without prejudice to their rights as stakeholders.
Enterprises having any of the relationships described in the first subparagraph through one or more other enterprises, or any one of the investors mentioned in paragraph 2, are also considered to be linked.
Enterprises which have one or other of such relationships through a natural person or group of natural persons acting jointly are also considered linked enterprises if they engage in their activity or in part of their activity in the same relevant market or in adjacent markets.
An ‘adjacent market’ is considered to be the market for a product or service situated directly upstream or downstream of the relevant market."
